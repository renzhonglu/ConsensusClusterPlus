Version 1.11.1. 
For large datasets, the input data (d) was modified to also accept a distance matrix which reduces computation time, and plotBMP was added a plot type so that large consensus matrices can be plotted. Internal data structures were modified to increase speed.  Distance metric options expanded ("maximum", "manhattan", "canberra", "binary","minkowski" from dist) and custom distance function option added.  Partitioning Around Mediods clustering (from cluster package) was added as a clustering algorithm.  Kmeans invocation ("km") was changed to run on a data matrix input by default. "kmdist" performs kmeans clustering on a distance matrix calcualted from the resampled data.  In  versions prior to 1.11.1, the "km" option refers to kmdist.  Users wishing to use this kmeans invocation in versions 1.11.1 or later should use option kmdist.

Version 1.5.1.  
1.0.1 changes were re-incorporated into Bioc 2.9, 2.8.  Version 1.0.1 was part of Bioc 2.6, but not part of Bioc 2.7.  

Version 1.0.1.  
Item-consensus calculation was corrected.  Consensus matric heat maps are now guaranteed to correspond to the scale.
